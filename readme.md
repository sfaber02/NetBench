A tool to run netowrk speed benchmarks and create graphs of the results.


## Installation
1. Install python 3.11
2. Install PIP then pipenv

## Ideas
- user inputs
    - save to file and load last inputs as defaults
- error / no data count
- implements tags
- add timestamp to each graph
- create default filename for saving
- make y axis lable dynamic based on units Mbits Mbytes etc
- change iperf settings to use json and eliminate parsing
- gracefully end test and graphing
